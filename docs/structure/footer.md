# Footer

The `footer` is the very last element on a page. It provides more detailed navigation for visitors, as well as any copyright notices.

``` html
<footer>
    <div class="menu">
        <b> Label </b>
        <nav> ... </nav>
    </div>
    ...
    <p> Copyright Notice </p>
<footer>
```

1. **(Menus)[../elements.md]**  
   A Solbit footer has one or more navigation menus, that may be optionally labelled.
2. **Copyright**   
   Most sites have at least one copyright notice and potentially multiple legal notices. These may be added as normal `p` (paragraph) elements inside the footer.
